# WTRTI-Profiles

1. Profile_RTSS_OSD - Intended for use with Riva Tuner Statistics Server and won't work without it
2. Profile_WTRTI_OSD - Uses WTRTI's own OSD and doesn't require RTSS

The only difference between the profiles is the position of the groups, which needs to be halved in RTSS OSD to end up in the same position.
Due to the fact that positions are set with absolute values and not percentages, the overlays will only appear in inteded positions on a 1920x1080 monitor.

# Tips

When loading a different profile, don't forget to change the OSD Type in WTRTI's settings.
If the RTSS OSD doesn't appear after strating the game, press Alt + Z to open the Nvidia overlay to make RTSS' OSD appear.
